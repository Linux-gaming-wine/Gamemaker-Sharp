#Logos
Here you'll find some high-quality logos I quickly whipped-up for the project in various sizes.
They're all under the MIT license like the rest of the project, so feel free to use em' in, say, your
game. :)

If you've got your own logo for the project, simply fork the repo, add your logos to your custom
fork, and merge/pull request the logos folder from your fork. That way I'll see your new logos and,
if I like em' (90% chance I will.. I mean, come on), I'll add them to the official repo! :)
