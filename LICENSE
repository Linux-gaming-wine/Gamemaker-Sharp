Game Maker is the intellectual property of YoYo Games Ltd. I do not claim otherwise, nor do I have any malicious intent.

No parts of Game Maker are included within Gamemaker-Sharp. While the syntax is extremely similar (it was meant to be that
way), it is all custom coding made from the ground up in MonoGame. And, of course, I'm legally allowed to place a license on
my own work. Hence I can proudly say that the following license applies to this project in it's entirety. (Except maybe MonoGame.
Still not sure how that works 100% yet. :|)

The font used in this software, as well as it's logos, is "Webly Sleek UI" by Mat Douglas, which is under ...er, well, I'm not
quite sure what license it's under. :| As indicated here: "http://www.dafont.com/weblysleek-ui.font", it's un-clear which license it's
under exactly ("Public domain/GPL/OPF" ...Okay?), but from the information I've gathered, all the licenses various sites say this font
is under say it *should* be useable.

If you fear of copyright issues with the included font, change icon.ico to a custom, copy-right free icon, set "GMSharp.GMSharp.useerrorfont"
to false in your code and delete "errorfont.xnb" and "errorfontheader.xnb" within your game's "Resources" folder. Do note, however, that this
will prevent "friendly" error messages from showing, and instead will cause your game to start acting pretty weird when it encounters an error.
